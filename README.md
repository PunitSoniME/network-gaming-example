# Code is written in Angular Version 11
# Production code is also checked in, in case you don't have Angular 11, You can directly run app from dist/network-gaming-example folder.

# Game Description

Game screen is separated in 3 blocks
1. To join user ( Do not refresh after join, other wise you will lose your current player name )
2. Score board and players who are in current game
3. Leader Board with highest score players on top and lower score players on bottom ( Current player will be highlighted by blue color so he/she can find their position on game leader board )

Game will lasts 30 rounds or when any player makes 21 score. Once winner will be decided, game will restart with new players and score board will be updated by the highest score player on top and lower score player on bottom.


# Note: I can make a code by which current game player won't lose their stats even after refresh.
